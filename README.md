# 🧬 Game of Life – Terminal Edition by Veles-venice

> “Where life is binary, death is frequent, and bugs are... part of evolution.”

Welcome to my take on **Conway’s Game of Life**, written in Python, built in a terminal, and debugged with pure spite(mostly) and caffeine(a little bit). This is my first real-ish solo script that *actually works* (yes, I’m surprised too).

---

## 🎯 What does it do?

This script simulates cellular life using:
- A randomly generated grid of cells (`#` for alive, ` ` for dead)
- Rules of life, death, and loneliness
- Infinite looping chaos (until you Ctrl+C or your terminal gives up)

Each generation prints a new frame in your terminal. Kinda hypnotic(Maybe). Kinda horrifying.

## ⚙️ How to Run It

1. Clone this repo or download `Gprac.py`
2. Run it with Python 3:
```bash
python Gprac.py
